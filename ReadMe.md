 # Code{

    {
  "short_name": "MyPWA",
  "name": "My Progressive Web App",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "./count.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": ".",
  "display": "standalone", // Ensures the app opens in full screen
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "orientation": "portrait" // or "landscape" based on your needs
}

<!-- The two entries in the "icons" array of your PWA's manifest.json file serve different purposes, ensuring that your app displays correctly across various devices and screen sizes. Hereâ€™s why having multiple icon sizes is important, usually icons with different resolutions are recomended -->
